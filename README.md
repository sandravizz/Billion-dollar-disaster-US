# Billion-dollar-disaster-US

In this repo I showcase the whole process of a web based data visualisation project using JavaScript libraries for the EDA as well as the final visualisation. 

Data source: [NCEI](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/events/US/1980-2023?disasters[]=all-disasters)

## EDA

The first step is always to check your data and variable structure and extreme values as well as general patterns and trends. For this purpose I used **arquero.js** as a data processing library and **plot.js** as a plotting library. Please find the whole process in this [Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@sandraviz/billion-dollar-disasters-arquero-js-plot-js?collection=@sandraviz/billion-dollar-disaster)
